We want to show the mood of every team member on our public website. Therefor we want to parse emojis out of slack messages and use this information therefore. 

The process / data flow is as following:

1. Connect a slackbot to your favorite slack
2. Handle messages of users and parse the last emoji
3. Send this emoji to a separate server
4. There you can use it e.g. to show the current mood of every team member.

Check out the team section at https://entwicklerheld.de/. As soon as we finished this for our own company, you can see the current mood of every team member on our public website.


Feel free to contribute or submit feedback :) 


Happy Coding.
